* ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Alexis and currently going to college.
* ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning nothing because I'm still confused on what path I should take.
* ðŸ’– I love [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) and I love configuring my [neovim configurations](https://github.com/Alexis12119/Simple) because I love the feeling doing something with my own hand and mind.
* âš¡ Fun fact: **I just use Github as backup because If I accidentally delete my configurations, I can still recover my configurations through github.**
